This website addresses software engineers' common issue: managing and accessing frequently used code snippets. Engineers often find themselves reusing the same pieces of code when working on various projects. 
However, manually locating and copying these snippets can be time-consuming and inefficient. This website provides a solution by offering a centralized platform for storing and organizing code snippets. 
Engineers can easily save their snippets and access them whenever needed, streamlining their workflow and saving valuable time.

## `Follow these instructions to run the website successfully`

## Step 1: Project's structure

The website contains three files namely ## index.html, ## style.css, and ## script.js. All these three files combined to make the code of under 100 lines and solve a basic problem 

index.html contains the structure of the website like tags, classes, and ids.

style.css contains the styles against the classes, ids, and tags

script.js file contains the JavaScript code that consists of functions for dynamically rendering the data on the website. It contains the function for rendering the code snippet and title on the webpage, along 
with the functions to add, copy, and search the code snippets by the title

## Step 2: Running the website using Visual Studio Code

Clone this project into your local system using the git commands as git clone <URL of this project>

Another way is to download the zip file and then unzip it

Now, when there is a folder of the project on your local system, open Visual Studio Code and click on the open folder it will open the folder containing index.html, style.css, and script.js. Now, go to index.html
press ctrl+A, and then right-click to see the option open with the live server. The URL opened will be http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html

## Step 3: Running the website directly 

After downloading the folder on the local system, click on the index.html file and it will open up in the browser. 

## Step 4: Build for Production

To build the app for production, use:
